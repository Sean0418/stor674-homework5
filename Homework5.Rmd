# Part 1: Git and GitHub Concepts (20 points)

## Question 1.1: Understanding Commits (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) What does a commit do in Git? Explain what information is stored in a commit.

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
A commit creates a snapshot of the project once. It stores the file contents, the author information, the time stamp, and commit message that hopefully explains the changes. 


**b)** (2 points) Why is it important to write descriptive commit messages? Provide an example of a good commit message and a bad commit message.

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
It is important to write descriptive commit messages because they allow collaborators and future self to understand the history and the reasoning for the changes in code. 

Good: Added the GRUDecoder file for the model architecture.

Bad: Update file.

## Question 1.2: Branching in Git (10 points)

**a)** (5 points) Explain how branching works in Git. What happens when you create a new branch? What command would you use to create a new branch called `feature-analysis` and switch to it?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
Branching makes a parallel version of the code to develop other features in isolation without affecting the main codebase. When I create a new branch, Git creates a pointer to the current commit. 

```
git checkout -b feature-analysis
```



**b)** (5 points) Git branching is often described as "super lightweight" compared to other version control systems. Explain why Git branching is lightweight. (Hint: Think about how Git stores branches and what happens under the hood when you create a branch.)

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
Git branching is super lightweight because a branch is just a reference to a specific commit instead of an actual copy of the file system. This action stores 41 bytes of data. 

## Question 1.3: Merging Branches (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) What is the purpose of merging branches? Describe the steps you would take to merge a branch called `feature-analysis` into the `main` branch.

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
Merging merges the changes to one branch into another branch. 

I would first check to the branch I want to merge into which is `main` in this case. Then I merge `feature-analysis` into `main`. 

```
git checkout main
git merge feature-analysis
```

**b)** (2 points) What is a merge conflict and when does it occur?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot reconcile differences between two branches such as having modified the same lines in a file between the branches.

# Part 2: Docker Image Creation and Deployment with Version Control (50 points)

In this section, you will create a Docker image that can run the `compute_bench.py` script (which you used in Homework 2), which benchmarks CPU/GPU performance using PyTorch. **You will version control the entire process using Git and GitHub, practicing branching and merging workflows.**

**Important Note on Operating Systems:** You may be working on macOS or Windows, but Docker containers run Linux by default. You will be building a **Linux-based container** that will run on Longleaf (which is also Linux). Docker handles the cross-platform compatibility automatically, so your Linux container built on macOS/Windows will work seamlessly on Longleaf's Linux environment.

## Question 2.0: GitHub Repository Setup (5 points)

Before building your Docker image, you will set up version control for your project.

**a)** (1 points) Create a new GitHub repository called `stor674-homework5` (or similar name). Initialize it with a README. Provide the GitHub repository URL.

**GitHub Repository URL:**

<!-- Your GitHub repo URL here -->
https://github.com/Sean0418/stor674-homework5 

**b)** (2 points) Clone the repository to your local machine, add the provided files (`compute_bench.py`, this `Homework5.Rmd`), and make your initial commit. What commands did you use?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Commands you used
git clone https://github.com/Sean0418/stor674-homework5
cd stor674-homework5/
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with homework files"
```

**c)** (2 points) Create a new branch called `docker-build` where you will develop your Dockerfile. What command did you use? Why is it good practice to use a separate branch for development instead of working directly on `main`?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command to create and switch to branch
git checkout -b docker-build

```

**Explanation:**

<!-- Why use a separate branch? -->
Using a separate branch isolates development changes from the working code so it doesn't mess it if something catastrophic happens in the separate branch

## Question 2.1: Understanding compute_bench.py (5 points)

**a)** (3 points) Read the `compute_bench.py` script. What does this script do? What is its main purpose?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
This script benchmarks the time it takes to perform a large tensor computation, by creating a tensor of N random numbers and raising each element to the 4th power. Its main purpose is to compare the computational speed of CPU vs the GPU. 

**b)** (2 points) What Python packages does `compute_bench.py` require?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->

```
import torch
import time
```
`compute_bench.py` requires the PyTorch and time package.

## Question 2.2: Create a Dockerfile (10 points)

Create a Dockerfile that:
- Uses an appropriate **Linux-based** base image with Python 3.9 or later
- Installs the required Python packages (PyTorch with CUDA support for GPU computing)
- Copies `compute_bench.py` into the container
- Sets the default command to run the script

**Important Considerations:**

- **Operating System**: Even if you're on macOS or Windows, Docker will build a Linux container. Use Linux base images (e.g., `python:3.9-slim` is based on Debian Linux).

- **CUDA Support**: Longleaf has NVIDIA GPUs. To enable GPU support in your container:
  - Option 1: Use official PyTorch image with CUDA: `pytorch/pytorch:2.0.0-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime`
  - Option 2: Install PyTorch with CUDA support: `pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118`
  - Note: The container itself doesn't need NVIDIA drivers (Longleaf provides those), but PyTorch needs to be CUDA-aware.

- **Testing Locally**: If your computer doesn't have an NVIDIA GPU, the container will still build and run (it will just use CPU). On Longleaf with GPU nodes, it will automatically detect and use the GPU.

**Instructions:**

1. Make sure you're on the `docker-build` branch
2. Create a file named `Dockerfile` in your repository
3. Write the Dockerfile content below:

```dockerfile
# Paste your Dockerfile content here

FROM pytorch/pytorch:2.0.0-cuda11.7-cudnn8-runtime

WORKDIR /app

COPY compute_bench.py .

CMD ["python", "compute_bench.py"]
```

**Grading Criteria:**
- Appropriate Linux base image selection (2 points)
- CUDA-enabled PyTorch installation (4 points)
- Proper file copying (2 points)
- Correct CMD or ENTRYPOINT (2 points)

## Question 2.3: Build and Test Docker Image (10 points)

**a)** (3 points) What command did you use to build your Docker image? Include the full command and explain each part.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Your command here
docker build -t stor674-hw5 .
```


**Explanation:**

<!-- Explain each part of your command -->

`docker build`: The command to build.

`-t stor674-hw5`: Tags the image with the name `stor674-hw5`

`.`: Look for the Dockerfile in the current directory


**b)** (4 points) What command did you use to run your Docker image locally to test it? Include the output you received.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Your command here
docker run --rm stor674-hw5
```

**Output:**

```
# Paste the output here
No GPU available, running on CPU only

CPU Computations:
Time for 10,000,000 elements: 0.3325 seconds
Time for 100,000,000 elements: 2.0886 seconds

Small sample of 10 random numbers:
tensor([-0.1326, -1.5500,  1.1859,  1.5597,  0.7008, -0.4011, -1.1648,  0.1153,
        -0.3273, -0.3363])

Saved data to mydata.pt

```

**c)** (3 points) Were there any issues you encountered during the build or test? How did you resolve them?

**Answer:**

<!-- Write your answer here -->
During the build, my laptop got very laggy I could not do anything else. It took around 1000 seconds. 

I also ran the container locally so there was no GPU. 

## Question 2.4: Version Control Your Docker Build (10 points)

Now that you have a working Dockerfile, let's commit it and merge it into the main branch.

**a)** (3 points) On your `docker-build` branch, add and commit your Dockerfile with a descriptive commit message. What commands did you use?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Commands to add and commit Dockerfile
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Added Dockerfile with Python CUDA image"

```

**b)** (4 points) Switch to the `main` branch and merge the `docker-build` branch into it. What commands did you use? Paste the merge message or output.

**Answer:**

```bash
# Commands to switch branch and merge
git checkout main
git merge docker-build
```

**Merge Output:**

```
# Paste merge output here
$ git merge docker-build
Updating 4748043..dc4c26f
Fast-forward
 Dockerfile | 7 +++++++
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Dockerfile
```

**c)** (3 points) Push your changes to GitHub. Verify that your repository now contains the Dockerfile on the main branch. What command did you use to push?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command to push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

**Verification:** Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser and confirm the Dockerfile is visible. ✓


## Question 2.5: Push to Docker Hub (10 points)

**a)** (3 points) Create a Docker Hub account (if you don't have one) and provide your Docker Hub username.

**Docker Hub Username:**

<!-- Your username here -->


**b)** (4 points) Tag your image appropriately and push it to Docker Hub. What commands did you use?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command to pull/convert Docker image to Apptainer


```

**b)** (3 points) What is the name of the Apptainer image file (.sif) that was created?

**Answer:**

```
# Filename here

```

**c)** (2 points) Test your Apptainer image interactively. What command did you use to run it?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command to run Apptainer image


```

## Question 3.3: Create Slurm Job Script (12 points)

Create a Slurm job script that runs your containerized `compute_bench.py` using Apptainer.

**Hint:** If you want to test with GPU support on Longleaf, you'll need to:
- Request a GPU partition (e.g., `#SBATCH -p gpu`)
- Request GPU resources (e.g., `#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1`)
- Your CUDA-enabled PyTorch in the container will automatically use the GPU!

**Instructions:**

1. Create a file named `run_compute_bench.sh` in your GitHub repository
2. Include appropriate Slurm directives (partition, time, memory, etc.)
3. Load necessary modules (if needed)
4. Run the Apptainer container

**Your Slurm Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Paste your Slurm script here









```

**Grading Criteria:**
- Appropriate Slurm directives (#SBATCH) (4 points)
- Correct Apptainer run command (6 points)
- Output redirection and job organization (2 points)

## Question 3.4: Submit, Verify, and Version Control (3 points)

**a)** (1 point) What command did you use to submit your job to Slurm?

**Answer:**

```bash
# Command here

```

**b)** (2 points) Provide the output of your job. Paste the contents of your Slurm output file (e.g., `slurm-jobid.out`). Also, add your Slurm script (`run_compute_bench.sh`) to your GitHub repository and push it.

**Job Output:**

```
# Paste your job output here








```

**GitHub Verification:** ✓ Pushed `run_compute_bench.sh` to repository

**c)** (BONUS: +2 points) Include a screenshot showing your job in the Slurm queue or completed job information using `squeue` or `sacct`. Also show that your job successfully utilized a GPU (if you requested one).
